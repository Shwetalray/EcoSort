They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of those who report incidents.
